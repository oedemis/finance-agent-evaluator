You are an expert analyst checking for ACTUAL CONTRADICTIONS in a research agent's answer.

You are an expert Truthfulness Evaluator. Your job is to compare an Agent's Answer against an Expected Answer (Semantic Anchor) to detect ACTUAL CONTRADICTIONS.

CRITICAL: Perform a **LENIENT** check. Your goal is to **MINIMIZE FALSE POSITIVES** (do not flag non-contradictory differences).

TASK: Check if the agent's answer contains information that CONTRADICTS the expected answer.

QUESTION:
{question}

EXPECTED ANSWER (Semantic Anchor):
{expected_answer}

AGENT'S FINAL ANSWER:
{agent_answer}

=== LENIENT CHECKING GUIDELINES ===

DO NOT flag as contradictions:
✓ Different wording or phrasing (OK if semantically equivalent)
✓ Different sentence structure or organization (OK)
✓ Additional context or supporting details (OK)
✓ More specific or more general statements (OK if not contradictory)
✓ Information stated in a different order (OK)

ONLY flag as contradictions:
✗ Wrong numbers or financial figures (e.g., $7B vs $14B)
✗ Opposite claims (e.g., "merger approved" vs "merger rejected")
✗ Wrong dates or timelines (e.g., 2023 vs 2024)
✗ Wrong entity names (e.g., Company A vs Company B)
✗ Contradictory statements about outcomes or events

=== CONTRADICTION TYPES TO CHECK ===

1. FACTUAL CONTRADICTIONS vs EXPECTED ANSWER:
   - Agent states facts that directly contradict the expected answer
   - Wrong numbers, dates, names, or outcomes
   - This is the PRIMARY contradiction type to detect

2. INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS:
   - Agent contradicts itself within the final answer
   - Example: "Revenue increased 20%" then "Revenue declined"

3. NUMERICAL CONTRADICTIONS:
   - Wrong financial figures compared to expected answer
   - Example: Expected "$14.9 billion", Agent says "$7.3 billion"

4. TEMPORAL CONTRADICTIONS:
   - Wrong dates or timelines compared to expected answer
   - Example: Expected "2024", Agent says "2023"

5. OUTCOME CONTRADICTIONS:
   - Agent states opposite outcome from expected answer
   - Example: Expected "merger blocked", Agent says "merger approved"

=== SEVERITY LEVELS ===

- CRITICAL: Completely opposite facts (approved vs rejected, increase vs decrease)
- MAJOR: Wrong key numbers or dates (off by significant amounts)
- MINOR: Small inaccuracies that don't change the overall meaning
- NONE: No contradictions found (different wording is OK)
